### 문제 설명

<p>Farmer John has taken his cows on a trip to the city! As the sun sets, the cows gaze at the city horizon and observe the beautiful silhouettes formed by the rectangular buildings.</p>

<p>The entire horizon is represented by a number line with N (1 <= N <= 40,000) buildings. Building i's silhouette has a base that spans locations A_i through B_i along the horizon (1 <= A_i < B_i <= 1,000,000,000) and has height H_i (1 <= H_i <= 1,000,000,000). Determine the area, in square units, of the aggregate silhouette formed by all N buildings.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: A single integer: N</li>
	<li>Lines 2..N+1: Input line i+1 describes building i with three space-separated integers: A_i, B_i, and H_i</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>

### 출력 

 <ul>
	<li>Line 1: The total area, in square units, of the silhouettes formed by all N buildings</li>
</ul>
